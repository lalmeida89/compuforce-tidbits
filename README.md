In this repo I have chosen two code snippets, one from my Node.js projects
and one from my React.js projects. The files have comments explaining how they were implemented
and why I have chosen those specifically.

### React.js

This is the end result of my React.js app where we map through a multi-dimensional
array revealing all the teams and all the players within those teams.

### Node.js

This is just for a little context on what the Band Together app looks like. If the
other user has liked you, clicking on the green thumbs up will instantly create a chatroom.
